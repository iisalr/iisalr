## Hi there, I'm Isa :)

I’m a software engineering graduate based in Costa Rica

I like building web apps, learning new technologies, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes.

If an idea sounds interesting, I’ll probably try to code it just to see if I can.

You’ll find some pinned projects here — mostly web systems developed through academic and personal work.

Currently open to junior software engineering opportunities where I can grow, learn, and build meaningful software.
